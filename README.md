# AzureTemplates
Public Repository for all my Azure Deployment templates making my work easier :)

Mainly geared towards my preffered method of building Azure Environments;
* Templates to deploy Hub and Spoke VNets (With an NVA, linked in the networking readme)
* Templates to deploy storage accounts for Fslogix and regular shares.
